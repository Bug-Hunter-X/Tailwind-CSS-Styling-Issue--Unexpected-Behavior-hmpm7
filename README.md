# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue: Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: unexpected behavior or styling inconsistencies. The issue may stem from several reasons, including:

* **Incorrect Class Names:** Typos or incorrect usage of Tailwind classes.
* **CSS Conflicts:** Conflicts with other CSS stylesheets applied to the same element.
* **Configuration Issues:** Problems with the Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`).

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version.
